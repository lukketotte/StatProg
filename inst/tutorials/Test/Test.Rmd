## Introduction
This document contains the exercises in the lectures of the first block, i.e. lectures 1 to 3. Most of the exercises has both multiple hints and a solution, in this case the final hint is the solution. 

You as a student are more than welcome to contribute to these exercise documents if you have ideas about nice exercises and would like to try out working with Github! You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/lukketotte/StatProg)

## Lecture 1


### Set 1
<ol>
<li> Create a vector `c("Hello", 12)`. What is the type of this vector? Why?
```{r vectype, exercise=TRUE}


```

```{r vectype-solution}
# R automatically converts to the lowest common type
x = c("Hello", 12)
typeof(x)
```
</li>
<li>
Use `length()` or `dim()` to determine the size of `vec1`, `list1` and `mat1` (these are available in the code box). Do you see when to use which? 
```{r typesCheck-setup}
vec1 = rep(1:3, times = 4)
mat1 = matrix(vec1, nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
x = c(1, 10, 8)
list1 = list(vec1, x)
```

```{r typesCheck, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r qTypes, echo = FALSE}
question("What does dim(vec1) return?",
         answer("[1] 3 3", message = "A vector does not have two dimensions"),
         answer("NULL", correct = TRUE),
         answer("[1] 3 1", message = "This would not be to strange, but keep in mind this is not techniqually a column vector in the linear algebra sense"),
         random_answer_order = TRUE)
```


`df1 = data.frame(name = c("A", "B"), size = c(1, 1.1))`


```{r qTypes2, echo = FALSE}
question("Consider the snippet above. What does dim(df1) return?",
         answer("[1] 2 2", message = "Remember that data frames are lists!"),
         answer("NULL", correct = TRUE),
         random_answer_order = TRUE)
```

</li>
</ol>

### Set 2
<ol>
<li> Create two vectors `a` and `b`of equal length using some arbitrary numbers.
</li>
<li> `cbind` (column bind) `a` and `b` and store in an object called `ab`
</li>
<li> check the class of `ab`
</li>
<li>
Extract the first column of `ab` and check its class.
</li>
```{r ab, exercise=TRUE}
## 1

## 2

## 3

## 4
```
```{r ab-hint-1}
### 3
class(...) 
```
```{r ab-hint-2}
### 4
mat[rows, cols] # do you remember how you could choose all indecies in one dimension?
```
```{r ab-solution}
# for example
a = c(1,2,3)
b = 4:6
ab = cbind(a,b)
class(ab)
class(ab[:,1])
```
</ol>

### Set 3
<ol>
<li> Calculate the unbiased sample standard deviation of `x`: $\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$
```{r sd, exercise=TRUE}
x = c(1.2, 3.2, 1.1, -2.1, 10.1, 10023.123)
```
```{r sd-hint-1}
x-mean(x) # the minus will be done elementwise
```
```{r sd-hint-2}
x^2 # the square will also be done element wise
```
```{r sd-hint-3}
(x-mean(x))^2 # this gives you the vector you need
```
```{r sd-solution}
sum((x-mean(x))^2) / (length(x) - 1)
```

</li>
<li>
Compare your result with the built-in `sd()`
```{r sd-1, exercise=TRUE}
x = c(1.2, 3.2, 1.1, -2.1, 10.1, 10023.123)
```
</li>
</ol>

### Extra problems
<ol>
<li>
```{r q1, echo = FALSE}
question("What is the result of `c(TRUE, FALSE) && TRUE`?",
         answer("FALSE", message = "We are not comparing the objects"),
         answer("TRUE", correct = TRUE),
         answer("TRUE FALSE", message = "Recall that the double logical symbols only evaluates as many terms as necessary"),
         random_answer_order = TRUE)
```
</li>
<li>
Calculate the t-test of $H_0:\mu = 0$ vs. $H_1:\mu \neq 0$ for `x`, defined as $t = \frac{\bar{x}}{\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{x}}}$ where $\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{x}}$ is the standard deviation of $\bar{x}$
```{r q2, exercise = TRUE}
set.seed(123)
x = rnorm(100, 0.5)
```
```{r q2-solution}
sqrt(n) * mean(x) / sd(x)
```

</li>
</ol>

## Lecture 2

### Set 1
<ol>
<li>
Write an `if` statement that prints the sentence "It is true" if `x` is equal to $3$ and "It is false" otherwise. Set `x` to $3$ and see that it works. Change `x` to 4 and see that you get the second statement.
```{r if1, exercise = TRUE}
x = 3
```
```{r if1-hint-1}
if(...) {
  # true
} else {
  # fase
}
```
```{r if1-hint-2}
if(x==3) {
  print(...)
} else {
  print(...)
}
```
```{r if1-solution}
if(x==3) {
  print("It is true")
} else {
  print("It is false")
}
```

```{r if2, exercise = TRUE}
x = 4
```
</li>
<li>
Try now to combine a conditional statement with subsetting. Let `x` contain 20 random numbers from the standard normal distribution. Check whether it has nay negative numbers, and if so extract these.
```{r neg, exercise = TRUE }
x = rnorm(20)
```
```{r neg-hint-1}
 # Create a boolean vector (recall that `<, >` are vectorized) and use that to subset
```
```{r neg-solution}
# Either 
x[x<0]
# ...or
if(any(x<0)){
  x[x<0]
}
```

```{r negQ, echo = FALSE}
question("Check the solutions in the above question (final hint). Is there any difference between the two solutions?",
         answer("yes", correct = TRUE),
         answer("no", message = "Does the if code actually return anything if all values are positive?"))
```

</li>
<li>
Adjust the above code so that if there are any negative numbers you multiply these by $-1$ and overwrite. The end result should be the vector of absolute values $|x|$.
```{r neg2, exercise = TRUE }
x = rnorm(20)
```
```{r neg2-hint-1}
x[...] = -x[...]
```
```{r neg2-solution}
# As before, either
x[x<0] = -x[x<0]
# ..or
if(any(x < 0)){
  x[x<0] = -x[x<0]
}
```


</li>
</ol>

### Set 2
<ol>
<li>
Write a `for` loop that prints the values $1,4,9,16$.
```{r for1, exercise = TRUE }

```
```{r for1-hint-1, eval=FALSE}
for(...){
  print(...)
}
```
```{r for1-hint-2}
# What is the square root of the values to print?
```
```{r for1-solution}
# Neat solution
for(i in 1:4){
  print(i^2)
}
# this works, but is not as nice!
x = c(1,4,9,16)
for(i in 1:length(x)){
  print(x[i])
}
```
</li>
<li>
Go back to the sum of `x` example and generate the vector of values to iterate over automatically based on the size of `x`. Next, change the size of `x` and without changing anything in the loop make sure that it still works.
```{r for2, exercise = TRUE }
x = rnorm(1000)
sumx = 0

```

```{r for2-hint-1, eval=FALSE}
1:length(x)
```

```{r for2-hint-2, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:length(x)){
  # add to sum term
}

# or

for(a in x){
  # add a to sum term
}
```
```{r for2-solution}
x = rnorm(1000)
sumx = 0
for(i in 1:length(x)){
  sumx = sumx + x[i]
}
```

```{r for3, exercise = TRUE }
x = rnorm(10)
sumx = 0

```

```{r forQ, echo = FALSE}
x = "ab"
question("Check the solutions in the above question (final hint). Is there any difference between the two solutions?",
         answer("yes", correct = TRUE),
         answer("no", message = "Does the if code actually return anything if all values are positive?"))
```
</li>
</ol>
### Set 3
<p>
For this set, the second problem is possibly the hardest you have worked with in programming yet! This difficulty is only due to lack of experience so make sure to think about your solution before you start writing it up. See the pattern and try to imagine the for loop in your head.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Consider the $AR(1)$ process:
$$
y_t = \phi y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t,
$$
where $\phi = 0.5$, $\epsilon_t \sim N(0,1)$ and $y_1 = 0$. Generate $y_2, \ldots, y_{100}$
```{r ar1, exercise = TRUE }
y = numeric(100)

```

```{r ar1-hint-1, eval=FALSE}
for(t in ?:100){
  # your code to generate the y as outlined in the model
}
```
```{r ar1-hint-2, eval=FALSE}
for(t in 2:100){
  y[t] = ...
}
```
```{r ar1-solution, eval=FALSE}
for(t in 2:100){
  y[t] = 0.5 * y[t - 1] + rnorm(1)
}
```
</li>
<li>
Now consider the $MA(1)$ process:
$$
y_t = \epsilon_t + \theta \epsilon_{t-1},
$$
where $\theta = 0.5$ and $\epsilon_t \sim N(0,1)$. The full model in matrix notation is
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
y_2 \\ y_3 \\ y_4 \\ y_5
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\theta & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \theta & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \theta & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \theta & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\epsilon_1 \\ \epsilon_2 \\ \epsilon_3 \\ \epsilon_4 \\ \epsilon_5
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
Create this matrix using a double loop, and then generate $y_2, \ldots, y_5$ by matrix multiplication.
```{r ma1, exercise = TRUE }
A = matrix(0, 4, 5)

```

```{r ma1-hint-1, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:4){
  # try to imagine how the inner loop behaves based on the pattern of the model matrix!
  for(j in ...){
    # your code
  }
}
```

```{r ma1-hint-2, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:4){
  # the pattern can be based on the diagonal! But here you want to take one more step along the row
  for(j in i:(i+1)){
    # Now you need to figure out how to seperate diagonal from off diagonal
  }
}
```

```{r ma1-hint-3, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:4){
  for(j in i:(i+1)){
    if(i == j){
      ...
    } else {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

```{r ma1-solution, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:4){
  for(j in i:(i+1)){
    if(i == j){
      A[i,j] = 0.5
    } else {
      A[i, j] = 1
    }
  }
}
y = A %*% rnorm(5)
```
</li>
</ol>

### Set 4, functions
<ol>
<li>
Create a matrix `xx` with $1000$ rows and $2$ columns. You can use `rnorm()` to fill it with numbers. What happens if you use the variance function on `xx`?
```{r fun1, exercise = TRUE }
variance <- function(x, unbiased = TRUE) {
  n <- length(x) # Number of observations
  if (unbiased) {
    res <- sum((x - mean(x))^2)/(n - 1) # Sample variance (unbiased)
  } else {
    res <- sum((x - mean(x))^2)/n # Sample variance (ML)
  }
  return(res)
}
```
```{r fun1-solution}
xx = matrix(rnorm(2000), nrow = 1000)
variance(xx)
```
</li>
<li>
Try to think of what the input `x` must be like for this function to work properly. Can you add an input check (useing `if` and `stop`) so that the function only computes the variance if the input is of the right form?
```{r fun2, exercise = TRUE }
variance <- function(x, unbiased = TRUE) {
  n <- length(x) # Number of observations
  if (unbiased) {
    res <- sum((x - mean(x))^2)/(n - 1) # Sample variance (unbiased)
  } else {
    res <- sum((x - mean(x))^2)/n # Sample variance (ML)
  }
  return(res)
}
```
```{r fun2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
variance <- function(x, unbiased = TRUE) {
  if(...){
    n <- length(x) # Number of observations
    if (unbiased) {
      res <- sum((x - mean(x))^2)/(n - 1) # Sample variance (unbiased)
    } else {
      res <- sum((x - mean(x))^2)/n # Sample variance (ML)
    }
    return(res)
  } else {
    stop(...)
  }
}
```
```{r fun2-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
variance <- function(x, unbiased = TRUE) {
  if(is.vector(x) && ...){
    n <- length(x) # Number of observations
    if (unbiased) {
      res <- sum((x - mean(x))^2)/(n - 1) # Sample variance (unbiased)
    } else {
      res <- sum((x - mean(x))^2)/n # Sample variance (ML)
    }
    return(res)
  } else {
    stop(...)
  }
}
```
```{r fun2-solution}
variance <- function(x, unbiased = TRUE) {
  if(is.vector(x) && is.numeric(x)){
    n <- length(x) # Number of observations
    if (unbiased) {
      res <- sum((x - mean(x))^2)/(n - 1) # Sample variance (unbiased)
    } else {
      res <- sum((x - mean(x))^2)/n # Sample variance (ML)
    }
    return(res)
  } else {
    stop("x is not numeric and/or a vector.")
  }
}

xx = matrix(rnorm(2000), nrow = 1000)
variance(xx)
```
</li>
</ol>
